# UGC Content Creator

Comprehensive workflow for creating short-form video content (15-60 seconds) that performs organically and scales to paid ads.

## When to Use

- Creating TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts content
- Developing video hooks that stop the scroll
- Writing scripts for short-form video
- Following platform-native best practices
- Identifying content that can scale to paid ads
- Building a content calendar for consistent posting
- Analyzing what's working and doubling down

## Core Philosophy

```
AUTHENTICITY > POLISH
├── Real scenarios beat studio setups
├── Phone footage feels native
├── Imperfect = relatable
└── Story > production value
```

**The Algorithm Rewards:**
- Watch time (people finishing your video)
- Shares (strongest signal)
- Saves (intent signal)
- Comments (engagement depth)

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Hook Ideation (10 hooks minimum)

Generate 10+ hook concepts before filming anything.

**Hook Types:**

**Pain Point Hooks**
```
- "Stop doing [mistake] if you want [result]"
- "Why does no one talk about [problem]?"
- "I wish someone told me this sooner"
```

**Curiosity Hooks**
```
- "The [unexpected thing] that changed everything"
- "I tried [thing] for [time]. Here's what happened."
- "The reason [cause] is why [problem]"
```

**Authority Hooks**
```
- "As a [role], here's what people get wrong"
- "After [X years/customers], this is the #1 thing"
- "[Expert] does this and no one notices"
```

**Trend Hooks**
```
- [Trending sound] + [your topic twist]
- "POV: You finally [solved problem]"
- "Things that just make sense: [solution]"
```

**Example Hook Bank:**
```markdown
## Hook Ideas: [Your Topic]

1. "Nobody talks about this part of [topic]..."
2. "I was today years old when I learned [fact]"
3. "Stop scrolling if you [target audience]"
4. "Here's what [expert type] won't tell you about [topic]"
5. "Wait... did that just happen?" [action in progress]
6. "The $[X] mistake I made so you don't have to"
7. "This took me from [before] to [after] in [timeframe]"
8. "POV: You finally figured out [solution]"
9. "Things nobody tells you about [topic]"
10. "If you're [target audience], watch this"
```

### Step 2: Script Structure (Hook → Problem → Solution → CTA)

**15-Second Script:**
```
[0-3s] HOOK: Pattern interrupt
[3-12s] CORE MESSAGE: Single point, max 2 sentences
[12-15s] CTA: One clear action
```

**30-Second Script:**
```
[0-3s] HOOK: Stop the scroll
[3-10s] PROBLEM: Relatable pain
[10-22s] SOLUTION: How it works
[22-27s] PROOF: Quick credibility
[27-30s] CTA: Next step
```

**60-Second Script:**
```
[0-3s] HOOK: Attention grabber
[3-15s] SETUP: Problem/context
[15-35s] STORY: Journey or demo
[35-50s] PAYOFF: Transformation
[50-57s] CTA: Clear action
[57-60s] TAG: Brand moment
```

**Script Template:**
```markdown
## Video Script: [Working Title]

**Target Audience**: [Who this is for]
**Goal**: [Awareness/Education/Conversion]
**Platform**: [TikTok/Reels/Shorts]

---

**HOOK (0-3s)**:
[Exact words]
Visual: [What's on screen]

**SETUP (3-10s)**:
[The problem/context]
Visual: [Supporting imagery]

**MAIN CONTENT (10-40s)**:
[Key points - one idea per 10 seconds max]
1.
2.
3.

Visual: [B-roll, demonstrations]

**CTA (40-60s)**:
[What you want them to do]
Visual: [CTA text overlay]

---

**ON-SCREEN TEXT**:
- Hook overlay:
- Key callouts:
- CTA:

**AUDIO**:
- [ ] Original audio / voiceover
- [ ] Trending sound: [link]
- [ ] Text-to-speech

**B-ROLL/VISUALS NEEDED**:
-
-
```

### Step 3: Filming Best Practices

**Setup:**
- **Lighting**: Natural light or ring light (avoid overhead harsh light)
- **Framing**: Vertical 9:16 aspect ratio
- **Background**: Clean, not distracting, or relevant to topic
- **Audio**: Use phone mic or lavalier (clear > professional)

**Delivery:**
- **Energy**: 20% more energy than feels natural
- **Eye contact**: Look directly at camera lens
- **Movement**: Keep it dynamic (walk, gesture, action)
- **Pace**: Speak slightly faster than conversation
- **Takes**: Film 3-5 takes, pick the best

**Platform-Native Tips:**

**TikTok:**
- Use trending sounds (check TikTok Creative Center)
- Native captions (auto-generated, don't burn in)
- Green screen for reactions
- Duets and stitches for engagement

**Instagram Reels:**
- Trending audio matters less than TikTok
- Slightly more polished aesthetic
- Can repurpose TikTok (remove watermark)
- Link in bio CTAs work well

**YouTube Shorts:**
- More informational content performs
- Evergreen content has longer shelf life
- Title matters for search
- Subscribe CTAs are effective

### Step 4: Editing Workflow

**Cut for Retention:**
- Remove all pauses and "ums"
- Cut dead space between sentences
- Keep pacing fast (especially first 3 seconds)
- Use jump cuts to maintain energy

**Text Overlays:**
- Hook text in first 1 second
- Key points highlighted
- CTA text at end
- Keep text under 20% of screen (readability)

**Captions:**
- Auto-captions for accessibility
- Edit for accuracy
- Style that's easy to read (large, high contrast)

**Effects (Use Sparingly):**
- Zoom-ins for emphasis
- Transitions between scenes (fast, not slow dissolves)
- Sound effects for key moments
- Minimal filters (natural > over-edited)

### Step 5: Publishing & Optimization

**Caption Formula:**
```
[Hook] + [Context] + [CTA] + [Hashtags]

Example:
"Nobody talks about this part of [topic]... [2-3 sentence context explaining value]. [CTA: Save this, share with someone, comment X]. #hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3"
```

**Hashtag Strategy:**
- 3-5 hashtags max (more = diluted)
- Mix of:
  - 1-2 broad reach (#fyp, #viral - low chance, high reward)
  - 1-2 niche (#yourtopic, #youraudience)
  - 1 brand/campaign hashtag

**Best Posting Times:**
- Test your audience, but common peaks:
  - Morning: 7-9am (commute, coffee)
  - Lunch: 12-2pm
  - Evening: 7-9pm (wind down)
- Weekdays generally > weekends for most niches

**Engagement in First Hour:**
- Reply to ALL comments within first 60 minutes
- Like every comment
- Ask follow-up questions in replies
- Share to your story
- Engage with 10 other posts in your niche before posting

### Step 6: Performance Analysis

**Primary Metrics (Quality):**
- **Watch Time**: Avg % watched (aim for >50%)
- **Shares**: Strongest signal (aim for >2%)
- **Saves**: Intent signal
- **Comments**: Engagement depth

**Secondary Metrics (Reach):**
- Views
- Likes
- Follower growth

**Conversion Metrics:**
- Link clicks
- Profile visits
- DMs received

**Content Audit Template:**
```markdown
## Top Performer: [Video Title]

**Stats:**
- Views: [X] (vs avg: [Y])
- Watch time: [X]%
- Shares: [X]
- Comments: [X]

**Why it worked:**
- Hook: [What grabbed attention]
- Topic: [Why it resonated]
- Format: [What style worked]
- Timing: [When posted, current trends]

**Replicate by:**
1. [Action item]
2. [Action item]

---

## Underperformer: [Video Title]

**What to change:**
- Hook didn't stop scroll
- Topic not relatable
- Too long/slow paced
- Posted at bad time
```

### Step 7: Organic-to-Ad Pipeline

**Identify Ad-Worthy Content:**
```
SIGNALS:
├── 2-3x above baseline views
├── High share rate (>2%)
├── Strong watch time (>50%)
├── Positive comments about product/solution
└── Link clicks / profile visits spike
```

**Adapt for Paid:**
```
MODIFICATIONS:
├── Keep the hook (it worked organically)
├── Tighten to 15-30 seconds
├── Clear single CTA
├── Add subtle branding
├── Test multiple hook variations
└── Create 3-5 ad variations
```

**Example Ad Variations:**
1. **Hook A** + Original body + CTA
2. **Hook B** (different angle) + Original body + CTA
3. **Hook A** + Tighter body (20s) + CTA
4. **Testimonial overlay** + Original + CTA
5. **Problem focus** (first half) + Solution (second half)
