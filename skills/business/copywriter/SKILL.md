# Copywriter

Complete workflow for writing compelling copy across video scripts, captions, and marketing messages that connect emotionally and drive action.

## When to Use

- Writing video scripts for TikTok/Reels/Shorts
- Crafting social media captions (short, medium, long)
- Adapting messaging for different audience segments
- Creating CTAs that convert
- Developing storytelling frameworks for content
- Writing ad copy for paid campaigns

## Core Principles

```
STORY > FEATURES
├── People remember stories, not specs
├── Emotion drives action, logic justifies
├── One clear message per piece
└── Specificity beats generality
```

**The Copywriting Hierarchy:**
1. **Hook** (stops the scroll)
2. **Story** (creates connection)
3. **Value** (shows benefit)
4. **CTA** (drives action)

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Choose Your Storytelling Framework

**Framework 1: Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)**
```
PROBLEM: Name the pain your audience feels
├── "Tired of [specific frustration]?"
└── Make it relatable and specific

AGITATE: Make them feel it deeper
├── Show consequences of inaction
├── "Every day you [problem], you're [losing/missing/suffering]"
└── Use vivid, emotional language

SOLVE: Present your solution
├── "Here's how [your solution] changes everything"
└── Connect solution directly to their pain
```

**Framework 2: Before-After-Bridge (BAB)**
```
BEFORE: Their current painful reality
├── Paint the picture of their struggle
└── "You're stuck doing [painful task]"

AFTER: The dream state they want
├── Show the transformation
└── "Imagine if you could [desired outcome]"

BRIDGE: How your product gets them there
├── "Here's how [solution] makes it possible"
└── Simple, clear path from before to after
```

**Framework 3: Story Spine**
```
ONCE UPON A TIME... [Setup - the before state]
EVERY DAY... [The routine/problem]
BUT ONE DAY... [The catalyst/discovery]
BECAUSE OF THAT... [The change begins]
BECAUSE OF THAT... [The journey continues]
UNTIL FINALLY... [The transformation]
AND EVER SINCE THEN... [The new normal]
```

**When to Use Each:**
- **PAS**: Product launches, problem-focused content
- **BAB**: Transformation stories, testimonials
- **Story Spine**: Long-form content, case studies, founder stories

### Step 2: Write Video Scripts

**15-Second Script Template (TikTok/Reels):**
```markdown
## Script: [Working Title]

**Audience**: [Who this is for]
**Goal**: [Awareness/Education/Conversion]

---

**[0-3s] HOOK**
Words: [Exact opening line - pattern interrupt]
Visual: [What's on screen]

Example: "Stop wasting money on [X]"
Visual: Text overlay + frustrated expression

**[3-12s] CORE MESSAGE**
Words: [Single point, max 2 sentences]
Visual: [Supporting imagery]

Example: "Here's what actually works: [simple solution]"
Visual: Demonstration or B-roll

**[12-15s] CTA**
Words: [One clear action]
Visual: [Text overlay with CTA]

Example: "Save this so you don't make my mistake"
Visual: CTA text + hand gesture to save button
```

**30-Second Script Template:**
```markdown
## Script: [Working Title]

**[0-3s] HOOK**
"[Pattern interrupt - question, unexpected statement, action in progress]"
Visual: [Attention-grabbing opening]

**[3-10s] PROBLEM**
"[Relatable pain point your audience feels daily]"
Visual: [Show the struggle]

**[10-22s] SOLUTION**
"[How it works / key benefit in simple terms]"
Visual: [Demonstration or explanation]

**[22-27s] PROOF**
"[Quick credibility - result, testimonial, stat]"
Visual: [Social proof, before/after, data]

**[27-30s] CTA**
"[What to do next - single, clear action]"
Visual: [CTA overlay]
```

**60-Second Script Template:**
```markdown
## Script: [Working Title]

**[0-3s] HOOK**
Words: [Attention grabber]
Visual: [Stop the scroll moment]

**[3-15s] SETUP**
Words: [The problem/context - make it relatable]
Visual: [Paint the picture of the struggle]

**[15-35s] STORY/DEMO**
Words: [The journey or explanation - show don't tell]
Visual: [Walk through the process or story]

**[35-50s] PAYOFF**
Words: [The transformation/result - the "aha" moment]
Visual: [Show the outcome]

**[50-57s] CTA**
Words: [Clear next step]
Visual: [How to take action]

**[57-60s] TAG**
Words: [Brand moment or reinforcement]
Visual: [Logo or closing statement]
```

### Step 3: Write Captions

**Short Captions (Under 125 characters) - For Quick Engagement**

**Formula**: [Hook] + [Key Point] + [CTA]

**Examples:**
```
- "This changed everything. Here's the one thing I did differently. Link in bio."
- "Stop doing [mistake] if you want [result]. Seriously."
- "POV: You finally [solved problem]. It's possible."
- "The $X mistake everyone makes with [topic]. Avoid this."
- "I wish someone told me this about [topic] sooner. Save this."
```

**Medium Captions (125-300 characters) - For Context + Value**

**Formula**: [Hook] + [Story snippet] + [Insight] + [CTA]

**Example:**
```
"I used to spend 5 hours on [task]. Then I learned [key insight].
Now I do it in 30 minutes and [better result].
The shift? [One specific change].
Save this for later when you need it."
```

**Long Captions (Storytelling) - For Deep Connection**

**Structure:**
```
Line 1: Hook that stops the scroll (question, bold statement, vulnerability)

Lines 2-4: Story setup (paint the picture)

Lines 5-8: The journey/struggle (make it relatable)

Lines 9-11: The turning point (what changed)

Lines 12-14: The lesson/insight (what they can learn)

Line 15: CTA (what to do with this information)

Use line breaks for readability (every 1-2 sentences)
```

**Long Caption Template:**
```markdown
[HOOK - Vulnerable or provocative opening]

[STORY SETUP]
I remember when [specific moment].
Every day I [struggled with problem].
It felt like [emotion].

[THE STRUGGLE]
I tried [thing 1], [thing 2], [thing 3].
Nothing worked.
[Specific failure or low point].

[TURNING POINT]
Then one day, [catalyst].
I realized [key insight].
Everything changed.

[THE TRANSFORMATION]
Now I [new behavior/result].
Instead of [old way], I [new way].
The difference? [Specific outcome].

[THE LESSON]
Here's what I learned: [Universal truth].
You don't need to [misconception].
You just need to [simple truth].

[CTA]
Save this if you needed to hear it today.
```

### Step 4: Adapt for Audience Segments

**Segment Analysis Template:**
```markdown
## Audience: [Segment Name]

**Demographics:**
- Age: [Range]
- Life stage: [Career, family status, etc.]
- Income: [Range if relevant]

**Psychographics:**
- Values: [What they care about deeply]
- Fears: [What keeps them up at night]
- Desires: [What they're striving for]
- Language: [How they talk, references they get]

**Messaging Adjustments:**
- **Tone**: [Casual/Professional/Funny/Serious]
- **Humor**: [Type that lands - sarcastic, self-deprecating, punny]
- **References**: [Cultural touchpoints they relate to]
- **Taboos**: [What to avoid - topics, phrases, styles]

**Message Focus:**
- **Lead with**: [Their primary pain point or desire]
- **Proof type**: [What they trust - data, testimonials, authority]
- **CTA style**: [How to ask - direct, soft, urgent]
```

**Segment Examples:**

**Millennials (28-43)**
```
REFERENCES: 90s/2000s nostalgia, "adulting" struggles, student loans
TONE: Self-aware, slightly sarcastic, authentic
VALUES: Experiences > things, work-life balance, authenticity
AVOID: Corporate jargon, "fellow kids" energy, try-hard slang

EXAMPLE:
"Remember when we thought being an adult meant having it all figured out?
Yeah, that was a lie. Here's what actually helps..."
```

**Gen Z (18-27)**
```
REFERENCES: Current memes, TikTok trends, climate/social issues
TONE: Direct, unfiltered, irreverent, meme-native
VALUES: Mental health, social impact, authenticity, individuality
AVOID: Trying too hard, outdated references, corporate speak

EXAMPLE:
"No one asked for my opinion but here it is anyway... [hot take]"
```

**Gen X (44-59)**
```
REFERENCES: Independence, practicality, "latchkey kid" resilience
TONE: Straightforward, no BS, skeptical of hype
VALUES: Quality, reliability, value, competence
AVOID: Excessive hype, youth-pandering, trend-chasing

EXAMPLE:
"Straight talk: This works because [clear reason]. No gimmicks."
```

**Parents (Young Kids)**
```
REFERENCES: Chaos, guilt, exhaustion, tiny wins, "survival mode"
TONE: Empathetic, validating, light humor about the struggle
VALUES: Family time, simplicity, peace, not screwing up kids
AVOID: Judgment, "perfect parent" imagery, unrealistic standards

EXAMPLE:
"If you're raising kids and barely keeping it together, this is for you.
No judgment, just [solution that actually helps]."
```

### Step 5: Craft Effective CTAs

**CTA Ladder (Match to Funnel Stage):**

**Soft CTAs (Awareness - Low Commitment)**
```
- "Save this for later"
- "Share with someone who needs this"
- "Drop a 🔥 if you relate"
- "Follow for more [topic]"
- "Tag someone who [does thing]"
- "Comment [word] if you agree"
```

**Medium CTAs (Consideration - Medium Commitment)**
```
- "Link in bio to learn more"
- "DM me [keyword] for details"
- "Check the comments for the resource"
- "Tap the link in my bio to see how"
- "Want the full guide? Link in bio"
- "Send this to someone who asked about [topic]"
```

**Hard CTAs (Conversion - High Commitment)**
```
- "Sign up free at [link]"
- "Use code [X] for [discount]"
- "Join [X] others who [achieved result]"
- "Limited spots - grab yours now"
- "Start your free trial today"
- "Get instant access: [link]"
```

**CTA Best Practices:**
```
✅ One CTA per piece (don't ask for follow, like, save, comment all at once)
✅ Make it specific ("Comment RED" better than "Comment below")
✅ Give a reason ("Save this so you don't forget")
✅ Create urgency when appropriate ("Only 5 spots left")
✅ Make it easy (link in bio, not long URL)

❌ Multiple CTAs (confuses the audience)
❌ Weak language ("Maybe check out...")
❌ No CTA at all (lost opportunity)
```

### Step 6: Writing Quality Checklist

**Before Publishing Any Copy:**
```markdown
- [ ] Hook stops the scroll (would YOU stop for this?)
- [ ] One clear message (can you summarize in one sentence?)
- [ ] Speaks to specific person (not "people" or "everyone")
- [ ] Benefits > Features ("You'll save 3 hours/week" not "Has automation")
- [ ] Emotion present (what will they FEEL? Relief? Excitement? Hope?)
- [ ] Specific > Vague (numbers, details, examples)
- [ ] CTA is clear and single (only one ask)
- [ ] Read aloud (does it sound natural, not "corporate"?)
- [ ] No jargon (would your grandma understand it?)
- [ ] Passes the "So what?" test (why should they care?)
```

## Copy Formulas Library

**The "Stop Doing X" Formula:**
```
"Stop [common mistake].
Instead, [better approach].
Here's why: [reason].
[CTA]"

Example:
"Stop buying followers.
Instead, engage with 10 accounts daily.
Organic reach beats fake numbers every time.
Follow for more growth tips."
```

**The "I Tried X for Y" Formula:**
```
"I tried [thing] for [timeframe].
Here's what happened: [result].
The biggest surprise? [insight].
[CTA]"

Example:
"I posted daily on TikTok for 30 days.
Went from 100 to 10K followers.
The biggest surprise? Consistency > perfection.
Save this if you're just starting."
```

**The "Nobody Talks About" Formula:**
```
"Nobody talks about [hidden truth].
Everyone focuses on [common topic].
But the real game-changer is [your insight].
[CTA]"

Example:
"Nobody talks about engagement rate.
Everyone obsesses over follower count.
But 1K engaged followers > 10K ghost followers.
Follow if you want real growth strategies."
```

## Common Mistakes

| Bury the value | Lead with the benefit |
| Multiple CTAs | One clear action |
| Write for everyone | Write for one specific person |
| Long sentences/paragraphs | Short punchy lines, use line breaks |
| Passive voice | Active voice |
