# Pricing Analysis

Help me analyze and optimize my pricing:

## Current State

1. **Product/Service**: What are you selling?
2. **Current pricing**: What do you charge now?
3. **Pricing model**: How do you charge (per seat, usage, flat)?
4. **Customer feedback**: What do customers say about price?

## Value Analysis

Understand the value delivered:

- What problem does this solve?
- What's the cost of NOT solving it?
- What alternatives exist and their pricing?
- What's the ROI for customers?

## Competitive Positioning

Map the competitive landscape:

- Who are the main competitors?
- How do they price?
- Where do you want to position (premium/value/budget)?

## Pricing Model Evaluation

Assess different models:

- Per seat: Does value scale with users?
- Usage-based: Is consumption measurable?
- Flat rate: Is the value consistent?
- Tiered: Can you differentiate meaningfully?

## Recommendations

Provide:

1. Recommended pricing model
2. Specific price points
3. Tier structure (if applicable)
4. Packaging strategy
5. Implementation approach

Include rationale for each recommendation.
