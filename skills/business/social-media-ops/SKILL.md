```

## Workflow

### Step 1: New Account Setup & Warming

**New Account Warming Protocol (7-Day Process):**

**Days 1-2: Passive Warming**
```
GOALS: Act like a real user, not a brand
├── Complete profile 100% (bio, photo, links, highlights)
├── Follow 20-30 relevant accounts in your niche
├── Like and save content (30 min/day, genuine interaction)
├── Watch content fully (don't skip)
└── NO posting yet (resist the urge)

WHY: Platforms detect bot-like behavior. New accounts that immediately post get flagged.
```

**Days 3-5: Light Engagement**
```
ACTIVITY:
├── Comment on 10-15 posts (thoughtful, not spam or generic)
├── Reply to comments in your niche
├── Share 1-2 stories (not main feed posts)
├── Continue liking/following (20-30/day)
└── Still no main feed posts

COMMENT QUALITY:
✅ "This angle on [topic] is brilliant. Have you tried [related idea]?"
❌ "Great post!" "Nice!" "🔥🔥🔥"
```

**Days 6-7: First Posts**
```
LAUNCH:
├── Post first piece of content
├── Immediately engage for 30 min after posting
├── Continue community engagement
└── Monitor for shadowban signs (sudden zero reach)

POST STRATEGY:
- Start with evergreen content (not time-sensitive)
- Use 2-3 hashtags max (not 30)
- Don't include links in first 3-5 posts
```

### Step 6: Crisis Management

**Negative Comment Protocol:**
```
ASSESS THE COMMENT:
├── Valid complaint → Respond empathetically, take offline
├── Misunderstanding → Clarify politely, public resolution
├── Troll/Bad faith → Hide or delete, don't engage
└── Offensive/Hate speech → Delete and block

RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
"Thanks for the feedback, [name]. I hear you on [their concern]. [Brief explanation or acknowledgment]. Happy to discuss further in DMs—shoot me a message?"

WHAT NOT TO DO:
❌ Delete valid criticism (looks defensive)
❌ Argue publicly (feeds trolls, looks unprofessional)
❌ Ignore (looks like you don't care)
❌ Get emotional (always respond professionally)
```

**Shadowban Recovery:**
```markdown
## Shadowban Checklist

### Signs of Shadowban
- [ ] Sudden 50%+ drop in reach
- [ ] Content not showing in hashtags
- [ ] Explore/FYP appearances stopped
- [ ] Only followers see content

### Recovery Steps
1. **Stop posting** for 24-48 hours (let account cool down)
2. **Remove flagged content** (check for violations)
3. **Check hashtags** (remove any banned hashtags)
4. **Go back to warming behavior** (engage, don't post)
5. **Post safe, high-quality content** (no links, no controversial)
6. **Report to platform** if it persists (Instagram: Settings > Help)

### Prevention
- Don't use banned hashtags (check shadowban testers)
- Don't overuse same hashtags repeatedly
- Don't post too frequently (max 1-2x/hour)
- Don't buy followers/engagement
- Don't violate community guidelines
