# Sales Playbook

Complete framework for building scalable, repeatable sales systems that convert prospects to customers.

## When to Use

- Building sales process for new product

```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

```markdown
## Ideal Customer Profile

**Demographics:**
- Company size: [Employees/Revenue]
- Industry: [Specific verticals]
- Geography: [Locations]
- Role/Title: [Who you sell to]

**Firmographics:**
- Technology stack: [What they use]
- Growth stage: [Startup/Scale-up/Enterprise]
- Funding: [Bootstrapped/VC-backed]

**Psychographics:**
- Pain points: [Top 3 problems]
- Goals: [What they're trying to achieve]
- Buying triggers: [When they buy]
- Budget: [Price range they can afford]

**Examples of Good Fit:**
- Company A: [Why they're ideal]
- Company B: [Why they're ideal]

**Examples of Bad Fit:**
- Company X: [Why they're not a fit]
- Company Y: [Why they're not a fit]
```

### Step 2: Craft Your Value Proposition

**Value Prop Framework:**
```
FOR [target customer]
WHO [has this specific problem]
OUR [product/service]
PROVIDES [key benefit with numbers]
UNLIKE [competitors]
WE [unique differentiator]
```

**Example:**
```
FOR B2B SaaS companies
WHO struggle with customer onboarding (60% churn in first 30 days)
OUR automated onboarding platform
PROVIDES 40% reduction in time-to-value and 25% higher retention
UNLIKE generic customer success tools
WE offer industry-specific playbooks and automated milestone tracking
```

**One-Liner:**
```
"We help [target] achieve [outcome] without [pain]."

Example: "We help SaaS companies reduce churn by 25% without hiring more customer success reps."
```

### Step 3: Qualification (BANT vs MEDDIC)

**BANT (Simpler, B2C/SMB):**
```markdown
## BANT Qualification

**Budget:**
- Can they afford it? $[Range]
- What's their budget? $[X]
- Decision authority over budget? [Y/N]

**Authority:**
- Who makes the decision? [Name/Title]
- Who else is involved? [Stakeholders]
- Decision process? [Committee/Individual]

**Need:**
- What problem are they solving? [Pain]
- How urgent is it? [1-10]
- Cost of not solving? $[X]/[Time]

**Timeline:**
- When do they need it? [Date]
- Why that timeline? [Reason]
- What happens if delayed? [Impact]

**Qualified?** [Yes/No]
**Next Steps:** [Schedule demo / Send proposal]
```

**MEDDIC (Complex, Enterprise B2B):**
```markdown
## MEDDIC Qualification

**Metrics:**
- What are their success measures?
- Current state metrics: [Numbers]
- Desired state metrics: [Numbers]
- How do they measure ROI? [Formula]

**Economic Buyer:**
- Who controls the budget? [Name/Title]
- What's their priority? [Business goal]
- What do they care about? [Key metric]

**Decision Criteria:**
- How will they decide? [Must-haves vs nice-to-haves]
- Who evaluates? [Technical team, exec team]
- What's the scoring? [Point system, checklist]

**Decision Process:**
- What's the buying process? [Steps]
- Who's involved at each stage? [Stakeholders]
- Timeline? [Dates for each step]

**Identify Pain:**
- What's the business problem? [Quantified impact]
- Who feels the pain most? [Department/Person]
- Cost of inaction? $[X]/year

**Champion:**
- Who will sell internally for you? [Name]
- Do they have influence? [Y/N]
- Are they coaching you? [Y/N]

**Qualified?** [Yes/No]
**Deal Score:** [X/10]
```

### Step 4: Discovery Questions

**The Goal: Understand Their World Deeply**

**Current State:**
```
- "Walk me through your current process for [X]."
- "What tools are you using today?"
- "How much time does this take per week?"
- "Who's responsible for this?"
```

**Pain Points:**
```
- "What's the biggest challenge with your current approach?"
- "What have you tried to solve this?"
- "Why didn't that work?"
- "What's this costing you? (time/money/opportunity)"
```

**Impact:**
```
- "If you could wave a magic wand, what would change?"
- "What would solving this enable you to do?"
- "How would this impact your team/company?"
- "What's at stake if this doesn't get solved?"
```

**Decision Process:**
```
- "How do decisions like this typically get made here?"
- "Who else needs to be involved?"
- "What would need to happen for you to move forward?"
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
```

**Discovery Framework (SPIN Selling):**
```
SITUATION: Understand their current state
- "How many customers do you have?"
- "What's your current process?"

PROBLEM: Identify pain points
- "What challenges are you facing?"
- "How is this impacting the business?"

IMPLICATION: Make pain bigger
- "What happens if this continues?"
- "How does this affect other areas?"

NEED-PAYOFF: Paint the solution
- "How would solving this help?"
- "What would that mean for your team?"
```

### Step 5: Demo/Presentation

**Demo Flow (20 minutes max):**
```markdown
## Demo Structure

**1. Recap Pain (2 min)**
- "Based on our conversation, you mentioned [X pain]"
- "Your goal is to [Y outcome]"
- "Today I'll show you exactly how we solve that"

**2. Show Solution (10 min)**
- Focus ONLY on features that solve THEIR pain
- Show, don't tell
- Use their data/examples if possible
- "Here's how you'd [specific task]..."

**3. Prove It (5 min)**
- Case study: "Company like yours saw [result]"
- ROI calculation: "Based on [their numbers], you'd save $[X]"
- Social proof: "[Number] companies use this for [use case]"

**4. Next Steps (3 min)**
- "Does this solve [their pain]?"
- "What questions do you have?"
- "What would you like to see next?"
- Schedule follow-up BEFORE you hang up
```

**Presentation Principles:**
```
✅ DO:
- Tailor to their specific pain
- Use their language/terminology
- Show, don't tell
- Quantify value ($X saved, Y% improvement)
- Leave time for questions

❌ DON'T:
- Feature dump
- Talk more than 60% of the time
- Skip their pain points
- Assume they remember past conversations
- End without clear next steps
```

### Step 6: Objection Handling (LAER Framework)

**LAER Method:**
```
LISTEN: Let them fully express the objection
ACKNOWLEDGE: Show you understand
EXPLORE: Ask questions to find root cause
RESPOND: Address the real concern
```

**Common Objections:**

**"It's too expensive"**
```
LISTEN: "I understand budget is a concern."
ACKNOWLEDGE: "Many customers felt the same way initially."
EXPLORE: "Help me understand - compared to what?" / "What budget did you have in mind?"
RESPOND:
- "Let me show you the ROI..." [Show calculation]
- "What's the cost of not solving this?" [Quantify pain]
- "We have [alternative option] at [lower price]"
```

**"I need to think about it"**
```
LISTEN: "Of course, this is an important decision."
ACKNOWLEDGE: "I'd want time to think too."
EXPLORE: "What specifically would you like to think through?"
RESPOND: [Address the REAL concern they reveal]
- If budget: Show ROI
- If timing: Understand why delay
- If features: Address gaps
- If trust: Provide references
```

**"We're already using [Competitor]"**
```
LISTEN: "I appreciate you sharing that."
ACKNOWLEDGE: "[Competitor] is a good product."
EXPLORE: "How's that going? What made you take this call?"
RESPOND:
- Don't trash competitor
- "Many customers switched from [Competitor] because..."
- "What would make you consider an alternative?"
- Focus on differentiation
```

**"Now isn't a good time"**
```
LISTEN: "I understand timing matters."
ACKNOWLEDGE: "Timing has to be right."
EXPLORE: "When would be better? What's happening now?"
RESPOND:
- "What would change in [timeframe]?"
- "What's the cost of waiting [X months]?"
- "Can we start small now and expand later?"
- Schedule specific future follow-up
```

**"I need to talk to [someone else]"**
```
LISTEN: "Absolutely, it's important they're involved."
ACKNOWLEDGE: "Getting buy-in is critical."
EXPLORE: "What will be most important to them?"
RESPOND:
- "Can we schedule a call with them included?"
- "What do you think their main concerns will be?"
- "I can prepare materials for you to share"
- Offer to present to decision-maker directly
```

### Step 7: Closing Techniques

**Assumptive Close:**
```
"Based on what we've discussed, this clearly solves [their pain].
When would you like to get started?"
```

**Alternative Close:**
```
"Would you prefer to start with the annual plan or monthly?"
"Should we begin with 10 licenses or 25?"
```

**Summary Close:**
```
"Let me make sure I understood correctly:
- You need to [solve X]
- We've shown how we do that
- The ROI is [Y]
- Your team is ready to start [timeline]
Does that sound right? What would you like to do next?"
```

**Trial Close (Gauge Interest):**
```
"If we can address [concern], are you ready to move forward?"
"On a scale of 1-10, how likely are you to proceed?"
(If <8: "What would make it a 10?")
```

**Direct Ask:**
```
"I think this is a great fit. Are you ready to get started?"
```

### Step 8: Pipeline Management
