# Writing Coach

Complete framework for writing clearly, editing ruthlessly, and communicating ideas with maximum impact.

## When to Use

- Writing emails, documents, or reports
- Editing drafts for clarity and impact
- Improving writing style
- Overcoming writer's block
- Learning to write for specific audiences
- Developing consistent writing habits

## Core Writing Principles

**Clarity First:**
```
BEFORE: "It is important to note that the implementation of the new
         system will be occurring in the near future."

AFTER:  "We're launching the new system next month."
```

**One Idea Per Sentence:**
```
BAD:  "The project was delayed because the vendor didn't deliver on
       time and we had to find a new supplier, which took two weeks,
       and then there were quality issues."

GOOD: "The project was delayed by four weeks. Our vendor missed their
       delivery date. Finding a replacement took two weeks. Quality
       issues caused another two-week delay."
```

**Active Voice > Passive Voice:**
```
PASSIVE: "The report was written by Sarah."
ACTIVE:  "Sarah wrote the report."

PASSIVE: "Mistakes were made."
ACTIVE:  "We made mistakes."
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Pre-Writing (Clarify Your Thinking)

**Before writing a single word, answer:**

```markdown
## Writing Brief

**Purpose**: Why am I writing this?
- [ ] To inform
- [ ] To persuade
- [ ] To instruct
- [ ] To entertain

**Audience**: Who will read this?
- Role:
- Knowledge level:
- What they care about:
- What they need to know:

**Key Message**: If they remember one thing, what should it be?
[One sentence]

**Desired Outcome**: What should happen after they read this?
[Specific action or understanding]

**Constraints**:
- Length: [Word count or time to read]
- Tone: [Formal / Casual / Technical / Friendly]
- Format: [Email / Report / Article / Docs]
```

**Example:**
```
Purpose: Persuade stakeholders to approve project
Audience: Executive team (busy, non-technical, care about ROI)
Key Message: This project will save $200K annually
Desired Outcome: Approval to proceed
Constraints: 1-page summary, professional tone
```

### Step 2: Structure First (Pyramid Principle)

**Lead with the conclusion, then support it.**

```
STRUCTURE:
1. Main point (conclusion)
2. Supporting argument 1
3. Supporting argument 2
4. Supporting argument 3
5. Evidence for each

NOT:
1. Background
2. History
3. Context
4. Analysis
5. Finally, the point (reader already lost)
```

**Email Structure Example:**
```
Subject: [Action needed] [Topic] by [Date]

Hi [Name],

[Main point: What you need and by when]

[Background: Why this matters - keep short]

[Next steps: Specific actions]

Thanks,
[Name]
```

**Document Structure Example:**
```markdown
## Executive Summary
[Key point in 2-3 sentences - the conclusion]

## Background
[Just enough context for the reader to understand]

## Analysis/Findings
[Your work, organized logically]

## Recommendation
[What you think should happen]

## Next Steps
[Specific actions, owners, dates]
```

### Step 3: Write the Terrible First Draft

**Permission to write badly:**

```
RULE: Your first draft's job is to exist, not to be good.

DO:
- Write without editing
- Get all ideas down
- Don't worry about word choice
- Keep momentum
- Write badly on purpose

DON'T:
- Edit as you write
- Delete anything
- Worry about perfection
- Stop to look things up (mark with [TK])
```

**Overcoming Writer's Block:**

**Technique 1: Brain Dump**
```
Set timer for 10 minutes.
Write everything you know about the topic.
No structure, no quality filter.
Just dump it all on the page.
```

**Technique 2: Talk It Out**
```
Imagine explaining to a friend.
Record yourself talking through the topic.
Transcribe (or use voice-to-text).
Edit the transcript.
```

**Technique 3: Start in the Middle**
```
Can't write the intro? Skip it.
Write the easiest section first.
Build momentum.
Come back to hard parts.
```

### Step 4: Edit Ruthlessly (Three-Pass System)

**Pass 1: Structure (The Big Picture)**

```markdown
## Structural Edit Checklist

**Opening:**
- [ ] Does it hook the reader?
- [ ] Is the main point clear in first paragraph?
- [ ] Would a busy person keep reading?

**Body:**
- [ ] Does each section have one clear purpose?
- [ ] Is the flow logical?
- [ ] Are there gaps in logic?
- [ ] Is anything out of order?

**Closing:**
- [ ] Does it reinforce the main point?
- [ ] Are next steps clear?
- [ ] Does it leave the reader satisfied?

**Cut Ruthlessly:**
- [ ] Does every section serve the purpose?
- [ ] What can be removed without losing meaning?
```

**Pass 2: Clarity (Line-by-Line)**

```markdown
## Clarity Edit Checklist

**Sentences:**
- [ ] Can any sentences be split? (1 idea per sentence)
- [ ] Are there words that can be cut?
- [ ] Is jargon necessary or can it be simplified?
- [ ] Are pronouns clear? (what does "it" refer to?)
- [ ] Are transitions smooth?

**Paragraphs:**
- [ ] One main idea per paragraph?
- [ ] Is the first sentence a clear topic sentence?
- [ ] Do sentences flow logically?

**Word Choice:**
- [ ] Are verbs active, not passive?
- [ ] Are nouns concrete, not abstract?
- [ ] Is language simple and direct?
```

**Common Clarity Fixes:**

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "It is believed that..." | "We believe..." |
| "There are many ways to..." | "You can..." |
| "In order to" | "To" |
| "At this point in time" | "Now" |
| "Due to the fact that" | "Because" |
| "In the event that" | "If" |
| "Has the ability to" | "Can" |
| "Make a decision" | "Decide" |
| "Utilize" | "Use" |
| "Facilitate" | "Help" |

**Vague → Specific:**

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Soon" | "By Friday" |
| "Many" | "47" |
| "Significant improvement" | "30% faster" |
| "Various factors" | "Cost, timeline, and quality" |
| "In the near future" | "Next month" |

**Pass 3: Style (Polish)**

```markdown
## Style Edit Checklist

**Voice:**
- [ ] Is the voice consistent?
- [ ] Is the tone appropriate for the audience?
- [ ] Does it sound like a human wrote it?

**Rhythm:**
- [ ] Do I vary sentence length?
- [ ] Does it read well aloud?
- [ ] Are there any awkward phrases?

**Polish:**
- [ ] Is there unnecessary repetition?
- [ ] Are transitions smooth?
- [ ] Does every word earn its place?

**Final Check:**
- [ ] Read aloud (catches awkward phrasing)
- [ ] Print and read on paper (see with fresh eyes)
- [ ] Have someone else read it (get feedback)
```

### Step 5: Style by Context

**Technical Writing:**

```
GOALS: Accuracy, clarity, completeness

DO:
- Define terms on first use
- Use consistent terminology
- Include examples
- Show, don't just tell
- Use code blocks, diagrams
- Prioritize accuracy over elegance

EXAMPLE:
"The API endpoint `/users/:id` accepts a GET request and returns
a user object. The `:id` parameter is the user's unique identifier.

Example request:
GET https://api.example.com/users/123

Example response:
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}"
```

**Business Writing:**

```
GOALS: Clarity, brevity, action

DO:
- Lead with the ask
- Keep it short (1 page max for most docs)
- Use bullet points
- End with clear next steps
- Make it skimmable

EXAMPLE:
"We need $50K to hire 2 engineers by Q2.

Benefits:
• Ship product 2 months faster
• Reduce technical debt
• Hit revenue target

Next steps:
• Finance review budget (Jane, by March 1)
• Post job listings (Tom, by March 5)
• Begin interviews (Team, March 15)"
```

**Persuasive Writing:**

```
GOALS: Convince, motivate action

STRUCTURE:
1. Open with their problem
2. Present your solution
3. Provide evidence
4. Address objections
5. Call to action

EXAMPLE:
"You're losing $10K/month to manual processes. [Problem]

Our automation tool eliminates 80% of manual work. [Solution]

Companies like yours saw ROI in 6 weeks. [Evidence]

Yes, it requires training, but we provide onboarding support. [Objection]

Let's schedule a demo this week. [CTA]"
```
