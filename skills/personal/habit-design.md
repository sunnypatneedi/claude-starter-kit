# Habit Design

Help me design a new habit using proven behavior science:

## Habit Identification

1. **What habit do I want to build?**
2. **Why does this matter?** What outcome am I after?
3. **Past attempts?** What has/hasn't worked before?

## Behavior Design (Tiny Habits Method)

Break it down:

- **Anchor**: What existing behavior can I attach this to?
- **Tiny version**: What's the 2-minute version?
- **Celebration**: How will I reward myself immediately?

## Make It Obvious (Cue)

Design the trigger:

- Where and when will I do this?
- What visual cue will remind me?
- How can I make it impossible to forget?

## Make It Easy (Routine)

Reduce friction:

- How can I make starting easier?
- What preparation can I do in advance?
- What's the smallest possible version?

## Make It Satisfying (Reward)

Build in rewards:

- What immediate reward can I give myself?
- How will I track progress visibly?
- How will I celebrate milestones?

## Handle Failure

Plan for setbacks:

- What's my "never miss twice" rule?
- What might derail me?
- How will I get back on track?

Create a concrete implementation plan I can start tomorrow.
