# Learning Plan

Help me create a structured learning plan:

## Topic Assessment

1. **What do I want to learn?** Be specific.
2. **Why?** What will I do with this knowledge?
3. **Current level?** Beginner/intermediate/advanced?
4. **Time available?** Hours per week I can dedicate?
5. **Learning style?** Reading, videos, hands-on, etc.?

## Learning Goals

Define clear learning outcomes:

- What will I be able to DO after learning this?
- How will I demonstrate competency?
- What's the minimum viable knowledge I need?

## Resource Curation

Help me find and evaluate resources:

- Books (1-2 foundational texts)
- Online courses (structured learning)
- Practice projects (hands-on application)
- Communities (where to get help)
- Experts to follow

## Study Schedule

Create a realistic schedule:

- Daily/weekly time blocks
- Milestones and checkpoints
- Spaced repetition for retention
- Practice vs. consumption ratio

## Progress Tracking

How I'll measure progress:

- Weekly self-assessment
- Projects to build
- Tests or certifications
- Teaching others

Create a concrete 30-60-90 day plan based on my inputs.
