# Goal Setting

Help me define clear, actionable goals:

## Goal Clarification

First, help me articulate what I want to achieve:

- What outcome do I want?
- Why does this matter to me?
- How will I know I've succeeded?

## SMART Framework

Transform my goal into SMART format:

- **Specific**: Exactly what will I accomplish?
- **Measurable**: How will I track progress?
- **Achievable**: Is this realistic given my constraints?
- **Relevant**: Does this align with my bigger picture?
- **Time-bound**: When will I complete this?

## Milestones

Break the goal into milestones:

1. What are the major phases?
2. What does "halfway" look like?
3. What quick wins can I get early?

## First Steps

Identify immediate actions:

- What can I do in the next 24 hours?
- What's the first real task?
- What might block me and how can I prepare?

## Success Visualization

Help me visualize success:

- What will life look like when I achieve this?
- How will I celebrate?
- What will this enable next?

Ask me questions to refine my thinking and make the goal concrete.
