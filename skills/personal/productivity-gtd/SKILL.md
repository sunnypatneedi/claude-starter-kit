# Getting Things Done (GTD)

Complete framework for implementing David Allen's GTD methodology to achieve stress-free productivity and mental clarity.

## When to Use

- Feeling overwhelmed by tasks and commitments
- Things falling through the cracks
- Mental clutter preventing focus
- Need a trusted system to manage everything
- Starting a new job or major life change
- Weekly planning and review sessions
- Want to achieve "mind like water" clarity

## Core GTD Principles

**Mind Like Water:**
- Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them
- External systems capture everything
- Trust your system completely
- Mental clarity enables better decisions

**Workflow Over Lists:**
```
CAPTURE → CLARIFY → ORGANIZE → REFLECT → ENGAGE

Not just todo lists - a complete workflow
```

**Two-Minute Rule:**
- If it takes <2 minutes, do it now
- Don't defer quick actions
- Reduces list bloat

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Capture Everything

**Capture Rules:**
```markdown
## Capture Commitments

**What to Capture:**
- Tasks and todos
- Ideas and insights
- Appointments and events
- Things people ask you to do
- Things you promise to do
- Random thoughts
- "Someday/Maybe" ideas

**Where to Capture:**
- Inbox (physical)
- Digital capture tool (Todoist, Things, etc.)
- Voice memos for on-the-go
- Email inbox
- Notebook

**Golden Rule:**
ONE capture location per medium (one physical inbox, one digital inbox)
Don't use multiple apps - pick ONE trusted system
```

**Capture Template:**
```
[ ] Thing that came to mind
[ ] Another thing
[ ] Email I need to respond to
[ ] Idea for project
[ ] Thing boss mentioned
```

### Step 2: Clarify (Process Your Inbox)

**The Processing Workflow:**

```
For each item in inbox:

1. WHAT IS IT?
   └─> Is it actionable? (Can you DO something?)

2. IF NOT ACTIONABLE:
   ├─> Trash (delete it)
   ├─> Reference (file for later)
   └─> Someday/Maybe (might do eventually)

3. IF ACTIONABLE:
   └─> What's the NEXT ACTION? (physical, visible activity)

4. WILL IT TAKE <2 MINUTES?
   ├─> YES: DO IT NOW
   └─> NO: Continue...

5. AM I THE BEST PERSON?
   ├─> NO: Delegate (add to "Waiting For" list)
   └─> YES: Continue...

6. IS IT A PROJECT? (requires >1 action)
   ├─> YES: Add to Projects list + define next action
   └─> NO: Add to Next Actions list

7. DOES IT HAVE A DEADLINE?
   ├─> YES: Add to Calendar
   └─> NO: Add to Context list (@home, @office, etc.)
```

**Clarifying Examples:**

```markdown
❌ BAD (Vague):
- "Deal with taxes"
- "Website"
- "Mom"

✅ GOOD (Specific next action):
- "Email accountant to schedule tax appointment"
- "Review homepage copy and note 3 improvements"
- "Call mom to discuss Thanksgiving plans"
```

### Step 3: Organize

**The GTD Lists:**

```markdown
## 1. Projects List
Any outcome requiring >1 action

**Format:**
- [Project Name] - Desired outcome
- Next Action: [Specific physical action]

**Examples:**
- Redesign website homepage - Have new design live
  Next Action: @computer - Review competitor homepages for inspiration

- Plan team offsite - Event scheduled with activities
  Next Action: @phone - Call venue to check availability

- Learn React - Build first working app
  Next Action: @computer - Complete React tutorial chapters 1-3

---

## 2. Next Actions (by Context)

**@computer** (at computer with internet)
- [ ] Research flight options for NYC trip
- [ ] Send project proposal to client
- [ ] Review pull requests on GitHub

**@home**
- [ ] Replace air filter
- [ ] Water plants
- [ ] File insurance documents

**@office**
- [ ] Print Q4 reports
- [ ] Meet with Sarah about budget
- [ ] Organize desk drawers

**@phone** (calls to make)
- [ ] Call dentist to schedule cleaning
- [ ] Follow up with vendor about order
- [ ] Check in with mentor

**@errands** (when running errands)
- [ ] Pick up dry cleaning
- [ ] Buy birthday gift for colleague
- [ ] Drop off package at post office

**@agenda:[Person]** (things to discuss)
- [ ] @agenda:Boss - Discuss vacation request
- [ ] @agenda:Sarah - Review Q1 goals
- [ ] @agenda:Team - Propose new process

**@anywhere** (can do anywhere)
- [ ] Review weekly goals
- [ ] Read article on leadership
- [ ] Brainstorm blog post ideas

---

## 3. Waiting For List
Things delegated or pending from others

- [ ] WAIT: Report from John (requested 1/15)
- [ ] WAIT: Client approval on design (sent 1/18)
- [ ] WAIT: Reimbursement for expenses (submitted 1/10)

---

## 4. Someday/Maybe
Things you might do, but not now

- Learn Spanish
- Take cooking class
- Visit Japan
- Write a book
- Start a podcast
- Learn piano

---

## 5. Calendar
ONLY hard landscape (specific time/date)

**Use for:**
- ✅ Appointments
- ✅ Deadlines
- ✅ Time-specific actions

**DON'T use for:**
- ❌ Regular tasks (those go in Next Actions)
- ❌ "I hope to do this today" (unreliable)

---

## 6. Reference
Non-actionable information you need

- Tax documents (2020-2025)
- Recipes
- Instruction manuals
- Meeting notes
- Research materials
```

### Step 4: Reflect (Weekly Review)

**The Weekly Review - Non-negotiable**

```markdown
## Weekly Review Checklist (60-90 minutes)

**Schedule:** Every Friday 4pm (or consistent time)

### 1. GET CLEAR (30 min)

**Capture:**
- [ ] Empty brain - write down everything on your mind
- [ ] Process physical inbox to zero
- [ ] Process email inbox to zero
- [ ] Process notes from meetings
- [ ] Collect loose papers, receipts

**Process:**
- [ ] Review "Next Actions" - are they still next?
- [ ] Review "Waiting For" - anything stuck?
- [ ] Review calendar (past 2 weeks) - capture loose ends
- [ ] Review calendar (next 2 weeks) - prepare

### 2. GET CURRENT (20 min)

**Projects:**
- [ ] Review project list - still relevant?
- [ ] Ensure each project has next action
- [ ] Add new projects that emerged
- [ ] Move completed projects to "Done" log

**Lists:**
- [ ] Review Next Actions by context
- [ ] Cross off completed items
- [ ] Add new actions that emerged

**Someday/Maybe:**
- [ ] Review list - anything ready to activate?
- [ ] Add new ideas

### 3. GET CREATIVE (10 min)

**Horizons of Focus:**
- [ ] Purpose & Principles: Am I aligned?
- [ ] Vision (3-5 years): Where am I headed?
- [ ] Goals (1-2 years): What milestones?
- [ ] Areas of Focus: Health, family, career, etc.
- [ ] Projects: Supporting my goals?
- [ ] Actions: Moving projects forward?

**Questions:**
- What's working well?
- What's not working?
- What should I start/stop/continue?
- What opportunities am I seeing?

### 4. PLAN NEXT WEEK (10 min)

- [ ] Review big rocks for next week
- [ ] Block time for important projects
- [ ] Identify top 3 priorities
- [ ] Feel confident and ready
```

### Step 5: Engage (Do the Work)

**The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions:**

```
When deciding what to do next, consider:

1. CONTEXT
   Where am I? What tools do I have?
   → Filter to @context lists

2. TIME AVAILABLE
   How much time before next meeting?
   → 5 min? Pick quick wins
   → 2 hours? Tackle meaty projects

3. ENERGY AVAILABLE
   How alert am I? (1-10)
   → High energy: Creative work, hard problems
   → Medium: Routine tasks, emails
   → Low: Organize, file, simple tasks

4. PRIORITY
   Given 1-3, what's most important?
   → Review project outcomes
   → Consider goals and deadlines
   → Trust your intuition
```

**The Six-Level Model (Horizons of Focus):**

```
Level 6: LIFE PURPOSE & PRINCIPLES
↓       Why do I exist? What are my values?
↓
Level 5: VISION (3-5 years)
↓       Where am I going? What's the big picture?
↓
Level 4: GOALS & OBJECTIVES (1-2 years)
↓       What do I want to achieve?
↓
Level 3: AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY
↓       What must I maintain? (health, finances, relationships)
↓
Level 2: PROJECTS
↓       What outcomes am I committed to? (>1 action)
↓
Level 1: NEXT ACTIONS
        What's the immediate physical step?
```

## Common Mistakes

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| Use calendar for wishes | Calendar = hard landscape only |
| Have multiple inboxes | One physical, one digital max |
| Skip weekly review | Non-negotiable sacred time |
| Keep lists in your head | External system for everything |
| Vague actions ("website") | Specific next action ("draft homepage copy") |
| Process inbox constantly | Batch process 1-3x daily |
| Put projects in next actions | Projects list separate from actions |
| Organize before clarifying | Capture → Clarify → THEN organize |

---

## GTD Workflows

**Daily Workflow:**
```

```

---

## GTD Checklists

**Daily Shutdown Routine:**
```markdown
- [ ] Process inbox to zero
- [ ] Review today's calendar - capture loose ends
- [ ] Review next actions - reschedule what didn't happen
- [ ] Capture anything on mind
- [ ] Review tomorrow's calendar
- [ ] Choose tomorrow's top 3
- [ ] Close all open loops
```

**Project Kickoff:**
```markdown
- [ ] Define successful outcome clearly
- [ ] Brainstorm all components
- [ ] Identify next action
- [ ] Add to projects list
- [ ] Schedule planning time if needed
- [ ] Note any waiting-for items
```

**Processing Inbox (Zero):**
```markdown
For each item:
- [ ] What is it?
- [ ] Is it actionable?
  - No → Trash / Reference / Someday
  - Yes → Next action?
- [ ] <2 min? Do now
- [ ] Delegate? Add to Waiting For
- [ ] Multi-step? Add to Projects
- [ ] Add next action to context list
- [ ] Move item out of inbox
```

## Troubleshooting

**"I'm overwhelmed by my lists"**
→ Do a mini-review: What can you delete, delegate, or defer to someday/maybe?

**"Things keep falling through cracks"**
→ Are you doing weekly reviews? That's where you catch everything.

**"I never look at my lists"**
→ Lists aren't trusted. Process inbox completely, or you'll revert to your head.

**"I have too many projects"**
→ Good! Projects list should capture ALL commitments. Then choose consciously.

**"I don't know what to work on"**
→ Use the 4 criteria: Context, Time, Energy, Priority

**"Weekly review takes too long"**
→ Do mini-reviews daily. Friday = just tie up loose ends.

## Advanced GTD

**Energy-Based Contexts:**
```
@high-energy - Creative work, problem solving
@medium-energy - Routine tasks, emails
@low-energy - Organizing, filing, simple tasks
```

**Time-Based Contexts:**
```
@5min - Quick wins
@30min - Focused tasks
@2hours - Deep work blocks
```

**Area of Focus Review (Monthly):**
```markdown
For each area (Health, Finances, Career, Relationships, etc.):

- What's working?
- What's not working?
- What should I start/stop/continue?
- Any new projects needed?
- Are current projects aligned?
```
