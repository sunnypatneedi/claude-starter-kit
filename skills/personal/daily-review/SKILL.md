# Daily Review

Guide me through a structured daily review:

## End of Day Reflection

1. **Wins**: What went well today? What am I proud of?
2. **Lessons**: What could have gone better? What did I learn?
3. **Gratitude**: What am I grateful for?
4. **Energy**: Rate my energy levels (1-10) - what affected them?

## Tomorrow Planning

1. **Top 3 Priorities**: What MUST get done tomorrow?
2. **Calendar Review**: What meetings/commitments do I have?
3. **Blockers**: What might get in my way?
4. **Preparation**: What can I do tonight to set up success?

Ask me questions to help me reflect deeply rather than just listing items.
