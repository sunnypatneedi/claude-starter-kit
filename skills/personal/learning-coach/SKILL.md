# Learning Coach

Complete framework for learning faster and retaining more using evidence-based study techniques.

## When to Use

- Learning new skills or subjects
- Preparing for exams or certifications
- Building study systems and schedules
- Improving retention and recall
- Accelerating skill acquisition
- Overcoming learning plateaus

## Core Learning Principles

**The Learning Pyramid (Retention Rates):**
```
Teaching Others: 90%
Practice: 75%
Discussion: 50%
Demonstration: 30%
Audio-Visual: 20%
Reading: 10%
Lecture: 5%
```

**Key Insight:** Active learning beats passive consumption every time.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Set Clear Learning Goals

**SMART Learning Goals Template:**
```markdown
## Learning Goal: [Skill/Topic]

**Specific**: [Exactly what you want to learn]
Example: "Learn to build REST APIs with Node.js and Express"

**Measurable**: [How you'll know you've learned it]
Example: "Build 3 functioning APIs with CRUD operations"

**Achievable**: [Breakdown into sub-skills]
Example:
1. HTTP methods and routing
2. Middleware and error handling
3. Database integration

**Relevant**: [Why this matters / how you'll use it]
Example: "Need this for upcoming job role"

**Time-bound**: [Deadline]
Example: "Complete in 4 weeks"

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Can explain concept to non-technical person
- [ ] Can build [specific project] without documentation
- [ ] Can debug common errors independently
```

### Step 2: Break Down Into Sub-Skills

**Skill Decomposition:**
```markdown
## Skill Breakdown: [Main Skill]

### Level 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Sub-skill 1: [Estimated time]
- [ ] Sub-skill 2: [Estimated time]
- [ ] Sub-skill 3: [Estimated time]

### Level 2: Application (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Sub-skill 4: [Estimated time]
- [ ] Sub-skill 5: [Estimated time]

### Level 3: Mastery (Week 5+)
- [ ] Sub-skill 6: [Estimated time]
- [ ] Sub-skill 7: [Estimated time]
```

**Example: Learning Python**
```
Foundation:
- Variables, data types, operators (2 hours)
- Control flow (if/else, loops) (3 hours)
- Functions and scope (3 hours)

Application:
- Working with files (2 hours)
- Error handling (2 hours)
- Building CLI tools (5 hours)

Mastery:
- Object-oriented programming (8 hours)
- Working with APIs (5 hours)
- Building real projects (20 hours)
```

### Step 3: Use Active Learning Techniques

**Technique 1: Active Recall**

Instead of re-reading, force retrieval from memory.

**How to Practice:**
```markdown
## Active Recall Session: [Topic]

**Step 1**: Study material for 25 minutes
**Step 2**: Close all resources
**Step 3**: Write down everything you remember
**Step 4**: Check what you missed
**Step 5**: Focus next session on gaps

**Questions to Answer** (without looking):
- What is [concept]?
- How does [X] work?
- When would you use [Y]?
- What's the difference between [A] and [B]?
```

**Technique 2: Spaced Repetition**

Review at increasing intervals to fight the forgetting curve.

**Spaced Repetition Schedule:**
```
NEW MATERIAL:
Day 1: Learn
Day 2: First review (1 day later)
Day 4: Second review (2 days later)
Day 7: Third review (3 days later)
Day 14: Fourth review (7 days later)
Day 30: Fifth review (14 days later)
Day 60: Sixth review (30 days later)

MASTERED: Review every 3-6 months
```

**Tools:**
- Anki (flashcard app with built-in spaced repetition)
- RemNote (note-taking + spaced repetition)
- Notion with manual scheduling

**Technique 3: Feynman Technique**

Teach the concept as if explaining to a child.

**Process:**
```markdown
## Feynman Technique: [Concept]

**Step 1: Learn**
[Study the concept]

**Step 2: Teach**
Explain it in simple terms:
[Write explanation as if teaching a 12-year-old]

**Step 3: Identify Gaps**
Where did your explanation break down?
- Gap 1: [What you couldn't explain]
- Gap 2: [What you got confused about]

**Step 4: Review & Simplify**
Go back, learn the gaps, simplify even more.
[Improved explanation]
```

**Example:**
```
Concept: REST APIs

Simple Explanation:
"A REST API is like a waiter at a restaurant. You (the client) tell
the waiter what you want (make a request), the waiter goes to the
kitchen (the server), gets your food (data), and brings it back to you.
Just like a waiter has a menu of what they can get you, an API has
endpoints that define what data you can request."

Gap: I couldn't explain WHY we use GET vs POST. Need to review HTTP methods.
```

**Technique 4: Interleaving**

Mix different topics instead of studying one topic for hours.

**Bad (Blocked Practice):**
```
Monday: 3 hours of JavaScript syntax
Tuesday: 3 hours of JavaScript syntax
Wednesday: 3 hours of JavaScript syntax
```

**Good (Interleaved Practice):**
```
Monday:
- 1 hour JavaScript syntax
- 1 hour HTML/CSS
- 1 hour problem-solving

Tuesday:
- 1 hour JavaScript functions
- 1 hour CSS layout
- 1 hour algorithms

Wednesday:
- 1 hour JavaScript objects
- 1 hour responsive design
- 1 hour debugging
```

**Why It Works:** Forces brain to retrieve and discriminate between concepts.

**Technique 5: Elaboration**

Connect new information to existing knowledge.

**Elaboration Questions:**
```markdown
## Elaboration: [New Concept]

**Connection Questions:**
- How does this relate to [something I already know]?
- Why does this work this way?
- When would I use this vs [alternative]?
- What would happen if [X] changed?
- How is this similar to [other concept]?
- How is this different from [other concept]?

**Example:**
Learning: React Hooks

Elaboration:
- Hooks are like state management in class components, but functional
- useState is similar to this.state, but you can have multiple
- useEffect is like componentDidMount + componentDidUpdate combined
- You'd use useEffect for side effects, useState for component state
```

### Step 4: Deliberate Practice

Practice with focus on weak points, not just comfort zone.

**Deliberate Practice Framework:**
```markdown
## Deliberate Practice Session: [Skill]

**Specific Goal**: [One sub-skill to improve]
Example: "Improve algorithm problem-solving speed"

**Targeted Weakness**: [What you struggle with]
Example: "I'm slow at recognizing when to use hash maps"

**Practice Plan**:
1. [Specific exercise] - [Time]
2. [Specific exercise] - [Time]
3. [Specific exercise] - [Time]

**Full Attention**:
- [ ] Phone off
- [ ] Timer set
- [ ] No distractions
- [ ] Just beyond current ability

**Immediate Feedback**:
- [ ] Check solution immediately
- [ ] Understand why it works
- [ ] Note what you missed

**Reflection**:
What improved? [Answer]
What still needs work? [Answer]
Next session focus: [Answer]
```

**The 3 Stages of Skill Acquisition:**

**Stage 1: Cognitive (1-2 weeks)**
```
GOAL: Understand what you're trying to do
├── Mental model of the skill
├── Watch experts
├── Read guides
└── Break down into steps

FEELS: Awkward, need to think about every step
```

**Stage 2: Associative (weeks to months)**
```
GOAL: Consistent execution
├── Practice with feedback
├── Identify errors
├── Build patterns
└── Speed increases

FEELS: Still effortful but more natural
```

**Stage 3: Autonomous (months to years)**
```
GOAL: Effortless performance
├── Skill becomes automatic
├── Can focus on strategy
├── Continue deliberate practice on weak areas
└── Teach others

FEELS: Natural, can do while thinking about something else
```

### Step 5: Memory Techniques

**Chunking:**

Group information into meaningful units.

```
PHONE NUMBER:
Bad: 4 1 5 5 5 5 1 2 3 4 (10 items to remember)
Good: 415-555-1234 (3 chunks)

CODE CONCEPTS:
Bad: Memorize 20 individual functions
Good: Group into categories (Array methods, String methods, Object methods)
```

**Mnemonics:**

**Acronyms:**
```
SOLID principles: Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution,
Interface segregation, Dependency inversion

HTTP Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete)
```

**Method of Loci (Memory Palace):**
```
1. Choose familiar location (your house)
2. Place items to remember at specific spots
3. Walk through mentally to recall

Example: Learning Git commands
- Front door: git init (initialize repo)
- Living room: git add (stage changes)
- Kitchen: git commit (save changes)
- Bedroom: git push (upload to remote)
```

**Stories:**
```
Weave facts into a narrative to make them memorable.

Example: Remembering OSI layers (7 layers of networking)
"All People Seem To Need Data Processing"
(Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)
```

**Dual Coding:**

Combine verbal + visual learning.

```
WHILE LEARNING:
- Draw diagrams
- Create mind maps
- Sketch concepts
- Use colors and shapes
- Visualize processes
```

### Step 6: Create a Learning Schedule

**Weekly Learning Plan Template:**
```markdown
## Learning Schedule: Week of [Date]

### Weekly Goal
[What you want to accomplish this week]

### Daily Schedule

**Monday**
- 7-8am: [Topic] - Active recall

### Review Schedule
- [ ] Day 2 review: [Topics from Monday]
- [ ] Day 4 review: [Topics from last week]
- [ ] Day 7 review: [Topics from 2 weeks ago]
```
