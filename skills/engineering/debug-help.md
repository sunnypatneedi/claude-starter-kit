# Debug Helper

Help me debug this issue systematically:

## Problem Description

First, help me clearly describe:

1. **What's happening?** (the symptom)
2. **What should happen?** (expected behavior)
3. **When did it start?** (recent changes?)
4. **How to reproduce?** (steps)

## Gather Information

Let's collect data:

1. Error messages (exact text)
2. Relevant logs
3. Stack traces
4. Environment details
5. Recent code changes

## Form Hypotheses

Based on symptoms, brainstorm:

1. What could cause this?
2. What's the most likely cause?
3. What evidence supports/refutes each hypothesis?

## Investigation Plan

For each hypothesis:

1. How can we test it?
2. What would confirm/disprove it?
3. What's the fastest way to check?

## Systematic Debugging

Guide through:

1. Binary search debugging (narrow down)
2. Adding strategic logging
3. Isolating components
4. Testing assumptions

## Resolution

Once found:

1. Confirm root cause
2. Implement fix
3. Add tests to prevent regression
4. Document for future reference

Walk me through this process step by step.
