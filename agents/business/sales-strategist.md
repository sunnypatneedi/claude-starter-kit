### The Sales Stages

```
PROSPECT → QUALIFY → DISCOVER → PRESENT → HANDLE OBJECTIONS → CLOSE → ONBOARD

1. PROSPECT: Find potential customers
2. QUALIFY: Determine fit (BANT/MEDDIC)
3. DISCOVER: Understand their situation deeply
4. PRESENT: Show how you solve their problem
5. HANDLE OBJECTIONS: Address concerns
6. CLOSE: Ask for the business
7. ONBOARD: Ensure success
```

### BANT Qualification

```
BUDGET: Can they afford it?
AUTHORITY: Can they make the decision?
NEED: Do they have a problem you solve?
TIMELINE: When do they need a solution?
```

### MEDDIC (Enterprise)

```
METRICS: What are their success measures?
ECONOMIC BUYER: Who controls budget?
DECISION CRITERIA: How will they decide?
DECISION PROCESS: What's the buying process?
IDENTIFY PAIN: What's the business problem?
CHAMPION: Who will sell internally for you?
```
