## Core Pricing Principles

```
PRICE TO VALUE, NOT COST
├── What is it worth to the customer?
├── What alternatives exist?
├── What's the ROI for them?
└── Cost is a floor, not a ceiling
```

## Pricing Models

### Model Comparison

```
| Model | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|-------|----------|------|------|
| Flat Rate | Simple products | Easy to understand | Leaves money on table |
| Per Seat | Team tools | Scales with company | Seat hoarding |
| Usage-Based | Variable consumption | Aligns with value | Unpredictable revenue |
| Tiered | Feature differentiation | Good/better/best | Complexity |
| Freemium | High volume, network effects | Low barrier | Conversion challenge |
| Hybrid | Complex products | Flexible | Harder to explain |
```

### Choosing Your Model

```
QUESTIONS TO ASK:
├── How do customers get value? (Per user? Per action? Per feature?)
├── How do competitors price?
├── What's easiest to understand?
├── What aligns sales incentives with customer success?
└── What's operationally feasible to measure?
```

## Value Metric Framework

### Identifying Value Metrics

```
GOOD VALUE METRIC:
├── Easy to understand
├── Aligns with value delivered
├── Scales with customer success
├── Hard to game
└── Easy to measure

EXAMPLES:
├── Slack: Per active user (not total seats)
├── Stripe: Per transaction
├── AWS: Per resource consumed
├── HubSpot: Per contact
```

### Value Metric Discovery

```markdown
## Value Metric Analysis: [Product]

### How Customers Get Value

1. [Value driver 1]
2. [Value driver 2]
3. [Value driver 3]

### Potential Metrics

| Metric        | Aligns with Value | Scalable | Measurable | Understandable |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| Per user      |                   |          |            |                |
| Per [action]  |                   |          |            |                |
| Per [outcome] |                   |          |            |                |

### Recommendation

Primary metric: [X]
Rationale: [Why this aligns best with value]
```

## Packaging Strategy

### Good/Better/Best Framework

```
TIER STRUCTURE:
├── STARTER (Entry): Solves basic problem, low commitment
├── PROFESSIONAL (Growth): Full solution, most popular
└── ENTERPRISE (Scale): Premium features, high touch

RATIO GUIDANCE:
├── Starter: Anchor low, get them in
├── Pro: 2-3x Starter (this is your target)
└── Enterprise: 3-5x Pro (custom for large)
```

### Packaging Template

```markdown
## Pricing Tiers: [Product]

### Tier 1: [Name] - $[X]/mo

**For**: [Who this is for]
**Includes**:

- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Limit: X of Y]

**Why this tier**: Entry point, prove value

---

### Tier 2: [Name] - $[X]/mo ⭐ Most Popular

**For**: [Who this is for]
**Includes**:

- Everything in Tier 1
- [Feature 3]
- [Feature 4]
- [Limit: X of Y]

**Why this tier**: Full value, best margin

---

### Tier 3: [Name] - $[X]/mo or Custom

**For**: [Who this is for]
**Includes**:

- Everything in Tier 2
- [Feature 5]
- [Feature 6]
- [Custom limits]

**Why this tier**: Enterprise needs, high touch
```

### Feature Gating Principles

```
GATE ON:
├── Scale (more users, more storage)
├── Power features (advanced functionality)
├── Support level (response time, channels)
├── Integrations (enterprise tools)
└── Security/compliance (SSO, audit logs)

DON'T GATE ON:
├── Core value (defeats purpose)
├── Essential features for success
├── Things that feel punitive
└── Anything that causes support burden
```

## Pricing Analysis

### Competitive Pricing Analysis

```markdown
## Competitive Pricing: [Market]

### Direct Competitors

| Competitor | Model | Entry Price | Mid Price | Enterprise | Notes |
| ---------- | ----- | ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ----- |
|            |       |             |           |            |       |

### Positioning Options

- **Premium**: Price above market - requires clear differentiation
- **Value**: Price at market - compete on features/service
- **Penetration**: Price below market - volume strategy

### Recommendation

Position: [X]
Price point: $[X]
Rationale: [Why]
```

### Price Sensitivity Testing

```
METHODS:
├── Van Westendorp: "At what price is this too cheap / expensive?"
├── Gabor-Granger: Direct price point testing
├── Conjoint: Feature + price trade-off analysis
└── A/B Testing: Actually test prices in market

QUICK SURVEY QUESTIONS:
1. "At what price would this be so cheap you'd question quality?"
2. "At what price would this be a bargain?"
3. "At what price would this be getting expensive?"
4. "At what price would this be too expensive to consider?"
```

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring

```
SHOW HIGHEST PRICE FIRST
├── Enterprise tier on left
├── Annual pricing as default
├── "Save X%" on annual
└── Compare to alternative cost
```

### Charm Pricing

```
$99 vs $100
├── Works for consumer products
├── Less effective for B2B
├── Use whole numbers for premium positioning
└── $X,000/mo reads more enterprise
```

### Decoy Effect

```
ADD A DECOY:
├── Make middle tier look best
├── High tier makes mid tier reasonable
├── Example: Small $5, Medium $8, Large $8.50
```

## Monetization Roadmap

### Launch Pricing

```markdown
## Pricing Launch Plan

### Phase 1: Validation (0-100 customers)

- Price: [Lower than target]
- Goal: Prove value, get feedback
- Signal: Customers say "this is a steal"

### Phase 2: Optimization (100-1000 customers)

- Price: [Move toward target]
- Goal: Test price sensitivity
- Action: Grandfather early customers

### Phase 3: Scale (1000+ customers)

- Price: [Target pricing]
- Goal: Maximize revenue per customer
- Action: Full pricing page, tiers, annual options
```

### Price Increase Framework

```markdown
## Price Increase Plan

### Current State

- Current price: $[X]
- New price: $[Y]
- Increase: [%]

### Customer Communication

- Advance notice: [30-90 days]
- Grandfather existing: [Yes/No - how long]
- Value justification: [What's improved]

### Messaging

"We're increasing prices for new customers on [date].
Here's what we've added: [value]
As a valued customer, [your special treatment]."

### Rollout

1. Notify existing customers [X] days before
2. Update pricing page on [date]
3. New customers on new pricing
4. Existing customers [grandfather plan]
```

## Output Format

When creating pricing strategy:

1. **Value analysis**: What customers pay for
2. **Model recommendation**: Which pricing model
3. **Tier structure**: Good/better/best packages
4. **Price points**: Specific numbers with rationale
5. **Competitive position**: Where you sit in market
6. **Implementation plan**: How to roll out
