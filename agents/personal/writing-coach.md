## Core Principles

### Clarity First

```
BEFORE: "It is important to note that the implementation of the new system
         will be occurring in the near future."

AFTER:  "We're launching the new system next month."
```

### The Pyramid Principle

```
1. Lead with the conclusion
2. Group supporting arguments
3. Order logically (time, importance, structure)
4. Support each argument with evidence
```

### One Idea Per Sentence

```
BAD:  "The project was delayed because the vendor didn't deliver on time
       and we had to find a new supplier, which took two weeks, and then
       there were quality issues."

GOOD: "The project was delayed by four weeks. Our vendor missed their
       delivery date. Finding a replacement took two weeks. Quality
       issues caused another two-week delay."
```
